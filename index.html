        "content": "There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland.\nThere used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shriveled and dried up along with the lake, and the people who lived there.\nDuring the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in the shade— if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake.\nThe only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the \"lake.\" A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that.\nThe campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.\nOut on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers.\nHere's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't bother them, they won't bother you.\nUsually.\nBeing bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't die.\nUsually.\nSometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake. Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake\nBut you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death.\nAlways.\nIf you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock.\nThere is nothing anyone can do to you anymore."

        "content": "Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the guard The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley A rifle lay across his lap\nStanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest His backpack lay on the seat next to him It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery\nhis mother had given him He'd promised to write to her at least once a week.\nHe looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.\nStanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.\nSometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now\nStanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.\nHe didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realizing it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid m the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy Mrs. Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.\nStanley was arrested later that day.\nHe looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes.\nStanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nIt was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!\nHe smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.\nSupposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a\none-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone\nThings went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nHe looked out the window at the vast emptiness. He watched the rise and fall of a telephone wire. In his mind he could hear his father's gruff voice softly singing to him\n\n\n\"If only, if only,\" the woodpecker sighs,\n\"The bark on the tree was just a little bit softer.\" While the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely, He cries to the moo— oo— oon,\n\"If only, if only.\"\n\n\nIt was a song his father used to sing to him. The melody was sweet and sad, but Stanley's favorite part was when his father would howl the word \"moon \"\nThe bus hit a small bump and the guard sat up, instantly alert.\nStanley's father was an inventor. To be a successful inventor you need three things: intelligence, perseverance, and just a little bit of luck.\nStanley's father was smart and had a lot of perseverance. Once he started a project he would work on it for years, often going days without sleep. He just never had any luck.\nEvery time an experiment failed, Stanley could hear him cursing his dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-grandfather.\nStanley's father was also named Stanley Yelnats. Stanley's father's full name was Stanley Yelnats III. Our Stanley is Stanley Yelnats IV.\nEveryone in his family had always liked the fact that \"Stanley Yelnats\" was spelled the same frontward and backward. So they kept naming their sons Stanley. Stanley was an only child, as was every other Stanley Yelnats before him.\nAll of them had something else in common. Despite their awful luck, they always remained hopeful. As Stanley's father liked to say, \"I learn from failure.\"\nBut perhaps that was part of the curse as well. If Stanley and his father weren't always hopeful, then it wouldn't hurt so much every time their hopes were crushed.\n\"Not every Stanley Yelnats has been a failure,\" Stanley's mother often pointed out, whenever Stanley or his father became so discouraged that they actually started to believe in the curse. The first Stanley Yelnats, Stanley's great-grandfather, had made a fortune m the stock market. \"He couldn't have been too unlucky.\"\nAt such times she neglected to mention the bad luck that befell the first Stanley Yelnats. He lost his entire fortune when he was moving from New York to California. His stagecoach was robbed by the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow.\nIf it weren't for that, Stanley's family would now be living in a mansion on a beach in California. Instead, they were crammed in a tiny apartment that smelled of burning rubber and foot odor.\nIf only, if only . . .\nThe apartment smelled the way it did because Stanley's father was trying to invent a way to recycle old sneakers. \"The first person who finds a use for old sneakers,\" he said, \"will be a very rich man.\"\nIt was this latest project that led to Stanley's arrest.\nThe bus ride became increasingly bumpy because the road was no longer paved.\nActually, Stanley had been impressed when he first found out that his\ngreat-grandfather was robbed by Kissin' Kate Barlow. True, he would have preferred living on the beach in California, but it was still kind of cool to have someone in your family robbed by a famous outlaw.\nKate Barlow didn't actually kiss Stanley's great-grandfather. That would have been really cool, but she only kissed the men she killed. Instead, she robbed him and left him stranded in the middle of the desert.\n\"He was lucky to have survived,\" Stanley's mother was quick to point out. The bus was slowing down. The guard grunted as he stretched his arms. \"Welcome to Camp Green Lake,\" said the driver.\nStanley looked out the dirty window. He couldn't see a lake. And hardly anything was green.\n\n"
